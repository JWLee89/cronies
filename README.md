# Cronies.js

A JavaScript Functional utility belt for handling data. Built with the purpose of fiddling around and practising JavaScript. Inspired by underscore.js and jQuery. 

Note: Korean comments are added, because I used parts of the source in projects where I was working with Korean developers.
